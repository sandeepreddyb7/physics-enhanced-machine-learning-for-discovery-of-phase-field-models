# Physics enhanced machine learning for discovery of phase field equations
This repository contains codes for discovery of phase field equations using a popular framework named "DeepMoD". This repository is forked from [https://github.com/PhIMaL/DeePyMoD]. In the examples folder, the codes for discovery of allen-cahn and cahn-hillard are provided with names "PDE_AC_discovery_latest.py" and PDE_CH_disocvery_latest.py". A presentation file names "bigmax_workshop_presentation.pdf" is also provided in the repository where more details pertaining to the discovery of phase-field equations are discussed. 


More information on the DeepMod package can be found in the following two papers: , [arXiv:2011.04336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04336), [arXiv:1904.09406](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09406) and the full documentation is availeble on [phimal.github.io/DeePyMoD/](https://phimal.github.io/DeePyMoD/).
